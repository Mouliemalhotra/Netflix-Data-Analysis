**Business Problem**

Netflix has a massive dataset of around 82,000 records containing information about their movies and TV shows. However, handling such a large volume of data makes it difficult to extract meaningful insights. They need a structured approach to analyze trends, understand viewer preferences, and make data-driven decisions to enhance the user experience.  

**Solution Approach**  

To tackle this challenge, I will use SQL to efficiently extract and analyze key information, such as viewer ratings, genre popularity, and watch trends. SQL will help in filtering, aggregating, and summarizing the data to uncover useful insights.  

Once the data is prepared, I will utilize Tableau to create interactive visualizations and dashboards. These visual tools will allow Netflix teams to explore trends effortlessly, such as identifying the most popular genres, analyzing audience preferences, and understanding regional viewing patterns. The goal is to provide an easy-to-use, data-driven solution that helps Netflix optimize content recommendations and improve user engagement.
